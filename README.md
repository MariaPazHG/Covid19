Covid19 Data Analysis
This project preprocess and merge datasets to calculate needed measures and prepare them for an Analysis. 
In this project, I work with the COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consists of 
the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths, per day, in each Country. 
Also, I used another dataset of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe.  
I merged these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how 
happy people are, living in that country.
